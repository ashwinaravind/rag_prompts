    Few-shot Examples:

    Example 1:
    Q: How does Transfer Learning improve model performance?
    Context: Transfer Learning allows models to leverage knowledge from pre-trained tasks and apply it to new, related tasks. By reusing features or embeddings learned during pretraining, models can adapt more quickly to smaller datasets and achieve better performance with less labeled data.
    A: Transfer Learning improves model performance by enabling models to reuse knowledge from pre-trained tasks. It leverages features or embeddings learned during pretraining to adapt efficiently to new, related tasks. This reduces the need for large labeled datasets and improves performance by transferring relevant insights, particularly when data for the new task is scarce.

    Example 2:
    Q: What are the advantages of using convolutional layers in neural networks?
    Context: Convolutional layers are a type of neural network layer designed to process spatial information. They use filters to detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes, making them ideal for image and video data. By leveraging shared weights and local connectivity, convolutional layers reduce the number of parameters and improve computational efficiency.
    A: Convolutional layers offer several advantages in neural networks. They are specifically designed to process spatial information using filters that detect patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes. This makes them highly effective for image and video data. Additionally, shared weights and local connectivity reduce the number of parameters, enhancing computational efficiency and scalability.
